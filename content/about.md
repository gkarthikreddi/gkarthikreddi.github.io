Thanks for visiting my site!

Hi, I'm Karthik, a student/programmer with a passion for technology. I'm currently doing my undergrad in Computer Science and I love learning how things work from the ground up. My goal is to build cool software that solves real problems and makes a difference.

I'm always curious, whether it's about new tech or finding better ways to code. I believe technology can help shape a better future, and I'm excited to be part of that journey.
